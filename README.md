Description
-----------
Finally, a way to handle BitTorrent files on the iPad and iPhone, with TorrentBox you can bookmark torrent files for use later. Just browse to .torrent files and choose 'Open in "TorrentBox"' where they are bookmarked and automatically synched to your Dropbox.com account.   Don't use Dropbox? No problem, the torrent files are bookmarked in-app so that you can retrieve them next time you sync with iTunes. TorrentBox is great for when you are on the go. Just bookmark the torrents you are interested in and they'll be waiting for you when you get home.  

Features
--------
* Bookmark BitTorrent files from other iOS apps (Safari, Mail, etc).
* Automatically sync bookmarked torrents with your Dropbox account.
* Create a Dropbox account from within TorrentBox.
* Manually access bookmarked torrents when syncing with iTunes.
* Remove bookmarked torrents in-app.

*NOTE:* TorrentBox is not a BitTorrent client, no P2P connections are established in the app.

Check out some [tips and tricks](http://github.com/brianpartridge/TorrentBox/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks).


Project Introduction
--------------------
This project's goal is to add support for handling BitTorrent metadata files to iOS devices.  By registering support for .torrent files, TorrentBox will be given access to such files when accessed in other apps, such as Safari.

iOS devices do not have the necessary resources for performing BitTorrent file transfers locally.  However, by pushing the .torrent files to another host the metadata can be used later to begin BitTorrent transfers on another host.

Using the [Dropbox API](http://www.dropbox.com) it is possible to do just this, so that BitTorrent transfers can be initiated manually later. In an advanced configurations, users may find it useful to have their BitTorrent clients watch their Dropbox directory and automatically begin transfers when new files are added.

TorrentBox is designed for iOS 3.2 and above.

TorrentBox has been rejected from the AppStore and will not be approved.  However, that shouldn't stop other developers capable of build and installing TorrentBox from using it on their personal devices.  TorrentBox was written to fill a niche need, so I'll be very happy if others get some use out of it.

Support

For those interested, a Pledgie link is available at the top of the page to allow donations to the project.  Thanks for the support!

That isn't all that is needed though.  I can handle the code, but TorrentBox needs some niceties.  If you can help with the design of a great icon or help create some great sound effects, it would really help put a nice shine or the app.

And if you can't donate or help with the niceties you can still spread the word.  Don't keep it to yourself though, tell friends about TorrentBox.  This is BitTorrent after all, the more peers the better.
